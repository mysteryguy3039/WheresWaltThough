# WheresWaltThough
Where's Walt Though was a side project after finishing the Battleship lesson on Codecademy.

What I want to do with this next:

 > Add a UI
 > Make it into an app
 
I don't expect this to go anywhere, but it'll at least give me the practice I need for the future. Such as publishing this onto GitHub to mess around with the different features. If anything, a friend and I enjoyed trying to use the smallest number of guesses on the largest board.
